# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** February 6 2025

Thank you for choosing **Family Charades** (“the App,” “we,” “our,” or “us”). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use the App on iOS devices. By using Family Charades, you agree to the practices described in this Policy.

<hr style="border-top: 1px solid black; margin: 2em 0; background: none;">

## 1. Overview

- **Platform**: iOS, Web
- **Intended Audience**: Families of all ages, suitable for children aged 4+  
- **Global Availability**: The App is offered worldwide.  

We are committed to safeguarding the privacy of our users, including children. Family Charades is designed to minimize data collection and does not require creating user accounts or collecting personal data such as names or email addresses.

<hr style="border-top: 1px solid black; margin: 2em 0; background: none;">

## 2. Information We Collect

1. **Non-Personal Usage Data (via Firebase)**  
   - **Analytics Data**: We use Firebase to collect general analytics on how the App is used. This may include:
     - Device information (type, model, OS version)  
     - IP address (used for region or language settings and to measure activity)  
     - Events (e.g., button clicks, session duration, screens viewed)  
   - **Purpose**: We collect this information to understand user engagement and improve the overall experience of the App.

2. **User-Generated Content**  
   - **Custom Words & Photos**: The App allows users to create custom Charades words and optionally attach pictures. These pictures are stored **locally on the user's device only** and are not uploaded to our servers or shared with third parties. We do not have access to these photos.

3. **Payment Information**  
   - **Subscriptions**: The App uses in-app purchases through Apple's App Store. We do not process or store payment information ourselves; all payment data is handled securely by Apple.

<hr style="border-top: 1px solid black; margin: 2em 0; background: none;">

## 3. How We Use the Information

- **Improving the App**: We analyze aggregated usage data from Firebase to identify trends, troubleshoot issues, and enhance gameplay features.  
- **No Personal Data**: We do not collect, process, or store personally identifiable information (such as names, emails, or phone numbers).

<hr style="border-top: 1px solid black; margin: 2em 0; background: none;">

## 4. Sharing & Disclosure

- **No Data Sharing**: We do not share any collected data with third parties for marketing, advertising, or any other commercial purposes.  
- **Service Providers (Firebase)**: We rely on Firebase solely for analytics. Data collected by Firebase is governed by Google's privacy policy and retained on their secure servers.

<hr style="border-top: 1px solid black; margin: 2em 0; background: none;">

## 5. Children's Privacy

Family Charades is designed for families with children aged 4+. We do not collect personal information from children, and we do not require user accounts or any form of personal data entry.

- **Parental Consent**: Since no personal data is collected, we do not require parental consent mechanisms.  
- **Local Storage Only**: Custom photos for charades clues remain on the user's device, ensuring no external transmission of children's images or information.

<hr style="border-top: 1px solid black; margin: 2em 0; background: none;">

## 6. Data Retention & Security

1. **Data Retention**:  
   - **Analytics Data**: Handled by Firebase under their data retention policies. We do not store or retain this data on our own servers.  
   - **No Personal Data**: Since we do not collect personal data, there is nothing to delete on our end.

2. **Security Measures**:  
   - We employ basic technical safeguards for the App, but critical data (e.g., payment details) is processed via Apple's secure in-app purchase system.  
   - Access to analytics data in Firebase is restricted to authorized personnel.

<hr style="border-top: 1px solid black; margin: 2em 0; background: none;">

## 7. Camera & Photo Access

- **Camera Permission**: The App may request access to your camera or photo library if you choose to add a photo to a custom word. This is entirely optional.  
- **Local Storage**: Any photos taken or selected remain on your device only; we do not upload or store them on our servers.

<hr style="border-top: 1px solid black; margin: 2em 0; background: none;">

## 9. Changes to This Policy

We may update or modify this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will post the revised policy with an updated "Effective Date" at the top. We encourage you to review this Policy periodically to stay informed about how we protect your information.
